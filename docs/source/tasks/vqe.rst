VQE Task Integration
====================

The VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) API endpoint in Qubio is designed to bridge theoretical quantum mechanics with practical biological applications. By exposing VQE as a RESTful service, we enable users to access quantum-enhanced ground state energy calculations through a simple API call.

Use Case in Qubio
-----------------

We use VQE to estimate the ground-state energies of short protein fragments. The lowest energy conformations typically correspond to the native folded state of a protein or peptide. Understanding this conformation is essential in:

- Protein structure prediction
- Stability assessment
- Protein-ligand interaction modeling

How We Use It
-------------

- **Sequence Input**: Users submit amino acid sequences via the `/predict` API.
- **Quantum Backend**: The algorithm simulates or executes on quantum hardware to compute the lowest energy configuration.
- **Energy Insight**: The results provide insight into how favorable or stable a sequence is in a biological environment.

This setup provides researchers with a quick way to query structural energy without needing to directly interface with quantum programming libraries or hardware.

Strategic Importance
--------------------

Making VQE accessible as an API:
- Democratizes quantum computing in life sciences.
- Supports easy benchmarking for quantum-enhanced protein design.
- Lays the foundation for hybrid simulations with AlphaFold or Rosetta in the future.
